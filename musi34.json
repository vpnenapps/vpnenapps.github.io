Musi does however, <strong>offer in-app purchases and advertisements<\/strong>. <br><\/p><p>&nbsp; <\/p><p>Musi stands apart from other music streaming apps, as the music it streams depends wholly on the user. Musi users search for their favorite artists and tracks on the app, which is scanning and pulling the audio directly from YouTube, and then individually add them to create custom playlists.&nbsp; Additionally, Musi does not feature a profanity filter.<\/p><p>&nbsp; <\/p><p>When users first open Musi, they\u2019re presented with a disclaimer messages letting them know that Musi does not save music or download songs to their device.<\/p><p>&nbsp; <br><\/p><p>Musi users should also be aware that streaming songs over a cellular connection will incur regular data charges, whereas streaming over WiFi will not affect data plans.<\/p><p>&nbsp; <\/p><p>The first thing Musi users want to do when they begin using the app is to start building their music library. Users create their Musi music library by searching for music from artists they enjoy or scanning and adding from listings of the most played songs on the app, trending songs, new music and featured playlists. <br><\/p><p>&nbsp; <br><\/p><p>Musi also gives users the option to search by genre, including Pop, R&amp;B\/Rap, Rock, Country, Indie, Electronic, K-Pop, and Reggaeton. In all, Musi features an eclectic mix of highlighted music, from prominent rappers to The Beatles and Neil Diamond.<\/p><p>&nbsp; <br><\/p><p>It\u2019s important to note that \u201CTop\u201D music picks are not based upon the Billboard music sales list, but rather YouTube\u2019s most streamed music videos.<\/p><\/div>",

When you search through Musi, it's basically like searching YouTube for music. The only difference is that Musi only streams the audio portion.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can start by searching for your favorite artists and adding the tracks you like. They are then added to your main library. From there you can sort songs into playlists however you'd like. Playlists are unlimited so you can create and manage them however you want. For many people, this may be a way to create albums. This is the only downside of Musi. Since it's simply searching YouTube for tracks, you need to add tracks one by one. It's not a <em>huge<\/em> deal if you don't mind creating playlists for artists or aren't the type of person that downloads entire albums anyways.<\/p>\r\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.imore.com\/sites\/imore.com\/files\/styles\/large\/public\/field\/image\/2014\/01\/musi_iphone_hero.jpg?itok=sh1INe2N\" width=\"350\"><div class=\"article-body__section article-body__section--narrow narrow\">\r\n<p>Musi also has support for AirPlay so you can stream anything you want to any AirPlay enabled device. Along with that you get background streaming as well so you can close out the app and continue doing something else while Musi continues to serve up tracks in the background.<\/p>\r\n<p>Obviously Musi isn't an all-in-one music solution since it won't work if you don't have an internet connection, but it's a super convenient ones for folks like me who are finicky with music. I have a nasty habit of only listening to things for a few weeks and then never really returning to them again. For stuff like that, Musi is perfect since I'm not spending money on songs and tracks I won't even want to listen to in a few weeks.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you give Musi a try, let us know what you think of it in the comments! Could you see yourself using it for music discovery and then only purchasing the albums and tracks you want to keep forever?<\/p><\/div><\/div>",

This \u201CN\u201D stands for \u201CNormal\u201D, which is the standard layer style, but you can also use a huge range of styles that will have a different impact on your artwork.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.thewonderforest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/procreate-screenshot-6.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"300\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, \u201Cmultiply\u201D will make the layer darker and slightly transparent, while \u201Cscreen\u201D will make it lighter. There are lots of settings here so take some time to experiment and research what each one does and how you might be able to use it.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you make a new layer, you can tap it to open the layer settings. This is where you can name, duplicate or clear your layer, or merge it with a layer below. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Within this menu, you\u2019ll see the options \u201CMask\u201D and \u201CClipping mask\u201D, which can be helpful for drawing. These options will allow you to add details or shading, but only over a certain area.

Procreate comes with a number of fantastic brushes already downloaded, but you can also buy brushes from other artists on places like Gumroad and Etsy. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These brushes can replicate everything from a fun and funky pattern, to impressively realistic watercolour paint. Take some time to look at what\u2019s available and see how you might use the brushes in your artwork. Over time, you will probably find favourite brushes that you come back to time and time again.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can also use brushes to smudge or erase your artwork. When you have smudge selected (the icon to the right of your brush), you can use your brush shape, texture, size and opacity to blend the colours of your drawing. Lots of artists use this for shading. Your eraser works in the same way, using your brush to erase layers.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You can edit brushes even further by clicking on the brush in your brush library. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.thewonderforest.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/procreate-screenshot-8.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"300\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Here you can edit absolutely every aspect of the brush, from simple concepts like the spacing and size, to the way colours wet mix together. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is also where you can play around with a setting called \u201CStreamline\u201D, which will subtly neaten the curves of your lines so they are less jittery and uneven. This may be a helpful setting while you are still getting used to drawing with Procreate, or if you are creating detailed linework.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you start to understand the brush settings, you can even use them to create your own brushes that are perfectly catered to what you want!<\/span><\/p><\/div>",
